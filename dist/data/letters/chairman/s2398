Dear Senator Hatch,
Thank you for your committed leadership in the Senate, in particular as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I am writing to you today in regards to Senate bill S.2398 - Clean Energy Worker Just Transition Act. This bill, introduced by Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont, addresses an import element to our country's transition towards clean sustainable energy. We must not leave behind a generation of workers while new technology supplants old industries. 
In the proud American tradition of innovation, we stand ready to embrace a future of clean renewable energy generation and S.2398 will help ease this transition for the hardworking Americanâ€™s of this nation's coal belt. I would like to see this issue debated on the floor of the Senate, and I think Americans everywhere would like to know who in their government is taking the concerns of working people to heart. Just as America deserves a clean energy future, the workers affected by this transition deserve a future with job security and economic promise. 
I urge you to look to the future and help ease the transition for the thousands of workers across the country and in Utah who will need to be retrained as our country shifts to solar and wind power. Please stand with Senator Sanders and use your leadership to help pass this bill.

Sincerely,

Paul Motschall
