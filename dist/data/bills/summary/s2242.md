The Save Oak Flat Act reverses the illconcieved land swap slipped into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The United States has a trust responsibility acknowledged by Congress to protect tribal sacred areas on Federal lands. These laws require meaningful consultations with affected Indian tribes before making decisions that will impact American Indians. Failure to nullify this land swap will mean the permament destruction of Oak Flat in pursuit of material wealth, degradation and depletion of the area's water supply and represents yet another betrayal by the United States government of the indigenous people and their sacred traditions.
