The goal of the Climate Protection and Justice Act of 2015 is to ensure that Carbon emissions contributed by the United states are reduced sufficiently to keep global average temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius. Implementing solutions that protect the lives of low income, minority and tribal communities and acknowledge the role that environmental degradation  has played in perpetuating racial social and economic inequalities.  We will empower our communities to be prepared and react to climate change while demonstrating to the world our nations commitment to aggressive reduction of carbon pollution emissions.
