S.J.RES.4 is a constitutional amendment that states that just as the right to vote is reserved for US citizens, so too shall the ability to finance our elections be reserved for natural U.S. Citizens. It also affirms the constitutional right for congress to protect the integrity and fairness of our elections and provides a mechanism of public financing to ensure our democracy is free from the corrupting influence and makes sure our elected officials have only the people to answer to.
