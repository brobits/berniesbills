Federal Charters provide important organizations like the Gold Star Wives legitimacy in the eyes of the governmental departments they interact with unfortunately this also precludes these organizations and their corporate officers from influencing legislation. S.1366 ammends the charter of the Gold Star Wives of America removing the prohibition against political influence and thereby, empowering the widows/widowers of our military heros. The Gold Star Wives know better than anyone the hardships and sacrafices that our military families make in service to their country, by amending their charter, we are making sure their well informed political voice is not silenced.
