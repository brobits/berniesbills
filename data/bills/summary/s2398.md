Legislation designed to provide benefits and services to workers who have lost their jobs or have experienced a reduction in wages or hours due to the transition to clean energy, to amend the National Labor Relations Act to establish an efficient system to enable employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations, and for other purposes. We cannot afford to leave behind thousands of workers or allow their need for good paying employment to be used as an excuse that slows our transition to clean renewable power generation. We can take care of hard working Americans, retraining and providing transitional assistance while combating global climate change.
