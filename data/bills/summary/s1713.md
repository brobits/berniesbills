The purpose of "The Low Income Solar Act" is to provide $200 million in loans/grants to low income Americans to install solar panels on their homes and to provide funding for community solar facilities that will benefit low-income communities. Low income households should be able to benefit from the money saving that solar can provide and also play a role in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.
