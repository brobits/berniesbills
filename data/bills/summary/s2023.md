The Prescription Drug Affordability Act amends Medicare and Medicaid in order to lower prescription drug prices as well as amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow individuals to import drugs from Canada. There is also provisions to speed up entry of generic drugs to the market as well as a requirement to force drug manufacturers to supply sales data for both foreign and domestic markets.

There are four ways that this bill will lower costs through the existing Medicare and Medicaid system. The first is through mandatory negotiations for lower prices by the centers for Medicare and Medicaid

- requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid to negotiate lower prices on behalf of beneficiaries for drugs covered under Medicare Part D;
- accelerates closure of the Medicare Part D coverage gap known as the "donut hole," under which beneficiaries who have reached a certain level of yearly drug costs become fully responsible for any additional drug costs up to a certain limit;
- requires drug manufacturers to issue rebates for prescription drugs dispensed to eligible low-income individuals under Medicare or Medicaid; and
- expands the application of certain prescription drug rebate requirements under Medicaid to include rebates for generic drugs.
