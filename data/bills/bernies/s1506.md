“The Economic Policy Institute recently told us that if you look at young people from 17 to 20 who are unemployed or working part-time, when they want to work full time, or given up looking for work, for white kids that number is 33 percent. For Hispanic kids the number is 36 percent. For African-American kids it is 51 percent.” - Senator Bernie Sanders
