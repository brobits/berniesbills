Senator Orrin G. Hatch
104 Hart Senate Office Building
Washington DC 20510

Dear Senator Hatch,
Thank you for your commitment to leadership in the Senate, in particular as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I am writing to you today in regards to Senate bill S.2391 - American Clean Energy Investment act of 2015. This bill, introduced by Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont, is vitally important for the future of American leadership in the world.
Our country has a well deserved reputation as a technological leader which has transformed the world’s economy many times over our short history, it is time that we apply that same leadership to clean energy and take a leadership position and once again transform the world’s economy. S.2391 deserves careful consideration and should be debated vigorously, amongst your colleagues.  Americans deserve the opportunity to benefit from the clean energy jobs that this bill will usher in, while at the same time we can assert our place as the global leaders in reforming our energy infrastructure moving beyond oil and giving us the security of full domestic energy production. The immediate tax incentives for adopting energy efficiency is a win win for both the economy and in our fight to combat global climate change.
I urge you to champion this bill, using your leadership position to bring this important investment in our future to the full attention of the US Senate. 
Sincerely,


Paul Motschall
